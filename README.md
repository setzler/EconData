EconData
================
Created by Bradley Setzler, University of Chicago

This directory contains two components:

  - [EconData](): R package to automatically download and prepare
    various publicly-available economic data sets.
  - [DataRepo]() A repository of prepared data sets that were created by
    the EconData package.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
devtools::install_github("setzler/EconData/EconData")
```

``` r
library(EconData)
```

The included data sets are listed below.

# 1\. Census CBP

### Download and clean the Census CBP

CBP data is managed by the `getCBP()` function. The arguments are:

  - `years`: years of CBP data to download (integer vector). Supported
    year range is 2002 to 2017.
  - `aggregation`: Geography and industry level of variation.
    `"state_total"` means state total, `"state_industry"` means
    state-by-industry total. Other options are `"county_total"`,
    `"county_industry"`, `"national_total"`, and `"national_industry"`.
  - `LFO`: Choose a legal form of organization (LFO). Options include
    `'C'` for C-corporations, `'S'` for S-corporations, `'P'` for
    partnerships. Default is `'-'`, which means to use all LFO types.

The resulting data set includes the variables `year, employment_march,
payroll_quarter1, establishments` as well as fips codes and industry
codes corresponding to the `aggregation` choice.

### Example

Here, we download and clean the CBP files during 2001 - 2017. They are
saved to the `DataRepo/` directory as
    `CBP_state_total.csv`.

``` r
CBP <- getCBP(years = 2001:2017, aggregation = "state_total") 
```

Letâ€™s plot the resulting data for the 5 most populous states:

``` r
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

CBP <- setDT(read.csv("~/github/EconData/DataRepo/CBP_state_total.csv"))

CBP[state_fips==36, state := 'New York']
CBP[state_fips==48, state := 'Texas']

gg <- ggplot(aes(x=year,y=employment_march/1e6,color=state,linetype=state),data=CBP[state != '']) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw(base_size=14) +
