This directory contains two
    components:

  - [EconData](https://github.com/setzler/EconData/tree/master/EconData):
    R package to automatically download and prepare various
    publicly-available economic data sets from source.
  - [DataRepo](https://github.com/setzler/EconData/tree/master/DataRepo)
    A repository of prepared data sets that were created by the EconData
    package.

<!-- end list -->

``` r

```

``` r
library(EconData)
```

The included data sets are listed below.

# 1\. Census CBP

### Download and clean the Census CBP

[Clean CBP data sets are located
here.](https://github.com/setzler/EconData/tree/master/DataRepo).

Census County Business Patterns (CBP) data is managed by the `getCBP()`
function. The arguments are:

  - `years`: years of CBP data to download (integer vector). Supported
    year range is 2001 to 2017.
  - `location`: Can be `"county"`, `"state"`, or `"national"`
    (character).
  - `industry`: Number of digits used in the NAICS code. `0` indicates
    use all industries.
  - `LFO`: Choose a legal form of organization (LFO). Options include
    `'C'` for C-corporations, `'S'` for S-corporations, `'P'` for
    partnerships. Default is `'-'`, which means to use all LFO types.

The resulting data set includes the variables `year, employment_march,
payroll_quarter1, establishments` as well as fips codes and industry
codes corresponding to the `aggregation` choice.

### Example

Here, we download and clean the CBP files during 2001 - 2017. They are
saved to the `DataRepo/CensusCBP` directory as
    `CBP_state_total.csv`.

``` r
CBP <- getCBP(years = 2001:2017, location = "state", industry = 0) 
```
