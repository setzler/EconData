### Download and clean the Census CBP


Census County Business Patterns (CBP) data is managed by the `getCBP()` function. The arguments are:

- `years`: years of CBP data to download (integer vector). Supported year range is 2001 to 2019.
- `location`: Can be `"county"`, `"state"`, or `"national"` (character).
- `industry`: Number of digits used in the NAICS code. `0` indicates use all industries.
- `LFO`: Choose a legal form of organization (LFO). Options include `'C'` for C-corporations, `'S'` for S-corporations, `'P'` for partnerships. Default is `'-'`, which means to use all LFO types.

The resulting data set includes the variables `year, employment_march, payroll_quarter1, establishments` as well as fips codes and industry codes corresponding to the `aggregation` choice.



### Demonstration

Here, we download and clean the CBP files during 2001 - 2019. They are saved to the `DataRepo/CensusCBP` directory as `CBP_state_total.csv`.

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
library(EconData)
CBP <- getCBP(years = 2001:2019, location = "state", industry = 0) 
write.csv(CBP,file="~/github/EconData/DataRepo/CensusCBP/CBP_state_total.csv", row.names=F)

```


Let's plot the resulting data for the 5 most populous states:

```{r echo=T, eval=T}

CBP <- setDT(read.csv(file="~/github/EconData/DataRepo/CensusCBP/CBP_state_total.csv"))
kable(CBP[1:5])

gg <- ggplot(aes(x=year,y=employment_march/1e6,color=state_name,linetype=state_name),data=CBP[state_name %in% c('California','Florida','Illinois','New York','Texas')]) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  theme_bw(base_size=14) + 
  labs(x="Year", y="March Employment (millions)",title="Census CBP",color="State",linetype="State") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= c(2000,2005,2010,2015,2020), limits=c(2000,2020)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks= pretty_breaks())
ggsave(gg,file='CBP_state_employment.png',width=8,height=5)

```
