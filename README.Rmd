This directory contains two components:

- [EconData](https://github.com/setzler/EconData/tree/master/EconData): R package to automatically download and prepare various publicly-available economic data sets from source.
- [DataRepo](https://github.com/setzler/EconData/tree/master/DataRepo) A repository of prepared data sets that were created by the EconData package.


```{r echo=T, eval=F}
devtools::install_github("setzler/EconData/EconData")
```
```{r echo=T, eval=T}
library(EconData)
```


The included data sets are listed below.

# 1. Census CBP

### Download and clean the Census CBP

[Clean CBP data sets are located here.](https://github.com/setzler/EconData/tree/master/DataRepo).

Census County Business Patterns (CBP) data is managed by the `getCBP()` function. The arguments are:

- `years`: years of CBP data to download (integer vector). Supported year range is 2001 to 2017.
- `location`: Can be `"county"`, `"state"`, or `"national"` (character).
- `industry`: Number of digits used in the NAICS code. `0` indicates use all industries.
- `LFO`: Choose a legal form of organization (LFO). Options include `'C'` for C-corporations, `'S'` for S-corporations, `'P'` for partnerships. Default is `'-'`, which means to use all LFO types.

The resulting data set includes the variables `year, employment_march, payroll_quarter1, establishments` as well as fips codes and industry codes corresponding to the `aggregation` choice.



### Example

Here, we download and clean the CBP files during 2001 - 2017. They are saved to the `DataRepo/CensusCBP` directory as `CBP_state_total.csv`.

```{r echo=T, eval=T}

CBP <- getCBP(years = 2001:2017, location = "state", industry = 0) 
write.csv(CBP,file="~/github/EconData/DataRepo/CensusCBP/CBP_state_total.csv", row.names=F)
print(CBP[])

```


Let's plot the resulting data for the 5 most populous states:

```{r echo=T, eval=T}

library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)

CBP[, state := '']
CBP[state_fips==6, state := 'California']
CBP[state_fips==12, state := 'Florida']
CBP[state_fips==17, state := 'Illinois']
CBP[state_fips==36, state := 'New York']
CBP[state_fips==48, state := 'Texas']

gg <- ggplot(aes(x=year,y=employment_march/1e6,color=state,linetype=state),data=CBP[state != '']) + 
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw(base_size=14) + 
  labs(x="Year", y="March Employment (millions)",title="Census CBP",color="State",linetype="State") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks= pretty_breaks()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks= pretty_breaks())
ggsave(gg,file='EconData/inst/CensusCBP/CBP_state_employment.png',width=8,height=5)
